🚨 CRITICAL EASYPANEL DEPLOYMENT ALERT 🚨
=========================================
Timestamp: 2025-12-10 05:42:49 UTC
Action: FORCED DEPLOYMENT SYNC
Status: URGENT - validate-system.sh deployment fix

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
- EasyPanel was NOT detecting our emergency commits
- Root cause: Local commits were NOT pushed to GitHub
- Solution: Commits now synchronized (6c33709 -> GitHub)
- Additional forced commit created for cache busting

CHANGES APPLIED:
✅ Dockerfile: Updated with forced deployment header
✅ package.json: Modified for cache busting
✅ Network resilience: npm install with retry logic
✅ validate-system.sh: Proper Dockerfile COPY commands
✅ CMD robustness: Conditional checks for file existence

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- GitHub commits synchronized
- EasyPanel should detect commit 6c33709
- Expected build success with network resilience
- Expected runtime with validate-system.sh working

NEXT ACTION REQUIRED:
Wait 2-3 minutes for EasyPanel to detect and deploy new commit.
Expected result: validate-system.sh found and executed successfully.
